| _LAB EXPT NO_ | PROBLEM STATEMENT |

| :-----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Consider a student database of SEIT class (at least 15 records). Database contains different fields of every student like Roll No, Name and SGPA. (array of structure)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Design a roll call list, arrange list of students according to roll numbers in ascending order (**Use Bubble Sort**)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Arrange list of students alphabetically. (**Use Insertion sort**)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Arrange list of students to find out first ten toppers from a class. (**Use Quick sort**)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Search students according to SGPA. If more than one student having same SGPA, then print list of all students having same SGPA.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Search a particular student according to name using binary search without recursion.<br>(All the student records having the presence of search key should be displayed)<br>(Note: Implement either Bubble sort or Insertion Sort.) |
| 2 | Implement stack as an abstract data type using singly linked list and use this ADT for conversion of infix expression to postfix, prefix and evaluation of postfix and prefix expression. |
| 3 | Implement Circular Queue using Array. Perform following operations on it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Insertion (Enqueue)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Deletion (Dequeue)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Display<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: Handle queue full condition by considering a fixed size of a queue.) |
| 4| Construct an expression tree for postfix expression and perform recursive and non- recursive Inorder, Preorder and Postorder traversals. |
| 5 | Implement binary search tree and perform following operations:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Insert (Handle insertion of duplicate entry)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Delete<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Search<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Display tree (Traversal)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Display - Depth of tree<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Display - Mirror image<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) Create a copy <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h) Display all parent nodes with their child nodes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) Display leaf nodes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j) Display tree level wise<br>**(Note: Insertion, Deletion, Search and Traversal are compulsory, from rest of operations, perform any three)**|
| 6 | Implement In-order Threaded Binary Tree. Traverse the implemented tree in Pre-order too. |
| 7 | Represent a graph of your college campus using adjacency list /adjacency matrix.<br>Nodes should represent the various departments/institutes and links should represent the distance between them. Find minimum spanning tree using<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Using Kruskal’s algorithm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Using Prim’s algorithm.<br>**Analyze above two algorithms for space and time complexity.** |
| 8 | Represent a graph of city using adjacency matrix /adjacency list. Nodes should represent the various landmarks and links should represent the distance between them. Find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm from single source to all destination. Analyze the implemented algorithm for space and time complexity |
| 9 | Implement Heap sort to sort given set of values using max or min heap. |
| 10 | Department maintains student’s database. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Write a program to create a sequential file to store and maintain student data.<br>It should allow the user to <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Create a student database<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Add a information of student<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Delete information of student<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Search and Display information of particular student.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. If student record is found it should display the student details.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Display Record of All students in tabular from |
